# HOW TO USE THIS FILE

# 1. Do not delete or reorder any of the above parameter lines.
#    Only edit them to change the parameter after the equal sign with a whitespace (" = ") on either side.
#    Without the precise formatting, the script will break and cause errors.
#    If you make a mistake concerning any of this, you can always download this file from its original source and replace it.

# 2. The parameter 'chart' determines which type chart is used for calculations.
#    Numbers 1, 2, and 6 are expected, but any integer from 0 to 9 inclusive is valid.
#    Later modifications refer to mechanics introduced across multiple Generations, but any chart may be used regardless of anachronisms.

# 3. The parameter 'single_types_only' determines whether the script only examines typings of a single type (AKA, "monotype").
#    Expected values are True or False (with capitalization).

# 4. The parameter 'check_weightings' determines whether extra calculations are done or not after initial calculations.
#    Expected values are True or False (with capitalization).

# 5. The parameter 'check_modifications' determines whether a specified typing has its matchups modified based on a variety of conditions.
#    Expected values are True or False (with capitalization).
#    All parameters after this one are only relevant if 'checkModifications' is set to True.

# 6. The parameter 'type_1' and 'type_2' are used to determine which typing should be modified.
#    Expected values are integers from 0 to 17 inclusive, 0 to 16 inclusive, or 0 to 14 inclusive, depending on which chart is being used.
#    It is preferred that 'type_1' be less than or equal to 'type_2', but this is not strictly necessary.
#    To modify a typing with a single type, make 'type_1' and 'type_2' equal to each other.
#    If 'single_types_only' is set to True, then modifications will not appear when modifying a dual typing.
#    To see which integers map to which type, please reference params_info.txt.

# 7. The parameter 'tera_type' is used to determine if the modified typing should use a Tera Type, and which one if so.
#    Expected values are integers from -1 to 17 inclusive, -1 to 16 inclusive, or -1 to 14 inclusive, depending on which chart is being used.
#    To forego Terastalization, input a value of -1.
#    To see which integers map to which type, please reference params_info.txt.

# 8. The parameter 'ability' is used to determine which Ability the modified typing should have, if any.
#    Expected values are integers from -1 to XX inclusive.
#    To forego having an Ability, input a value of -1.
#    Only Abilities that directly affect the effectiveness a specific number of types are considered - other effects are ignored.
#    If all or part of an Ability's effect has a trigger condition (i.e. Flash Fire, Swarm), then the condition is always considered to be met.
#    To see which integers map to which Ability, please reference params_info.txt.

# 9. The parameter 'item'

# 10. The parameter 'weather'

# 11. The parameter 'terrain'

# 12. The parameter 'move'

# 13. The parameters 'effects_on_self' and 'effects_on_opponent'

# 14. The parameter 'effects_on_battle'
